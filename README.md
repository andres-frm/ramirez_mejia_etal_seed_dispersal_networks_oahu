This repository holds the `R` script needed to reproduce data wrangling, modeling, and simulations from __Ramírez-Mejía et al.__. Also includes annotated code in `.pdf` Appendix files, including the `.r` raw code. Once the manuscript is accepted, the raw data and code will be stored in a public repository that ensures they are discoverable, freely reusable, and citable (e.g. Dryad, Zenodo).
